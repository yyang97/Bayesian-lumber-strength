The result is based on moving some outliers to the 100 groups. 


```{r}
lpthresh <- readRDS("lpthresh.rds")
colnames(lpthresh) <- c("threshold", "lp")
lpthresh
```
So the first row is the threshold I used, which is `seq(.85,.95,.01)`. The second line is the lp value in the server.


```{r}
plot(lpthresh[,1], lpthresh[,2] , type = 'l', xlab = 'threshold', ylab = 'lp')
```


```{r}
lpthresh[which.max(lpthresh[,2]),]
```

It tells me `threshold = .89` can maximize the log-posterior. 


```{r}
real_fit <- readRDS("realfit089.rds")
print(real_fit)
```
This is the result I got with `threshold = .89`.
